# friend recommender on Federated social networks 


Federated social network is popular nowadays because it protects usersâ€™ privacy. Friend recommender based on decentralized social network is important and also hard to tackle since there are only limited user information can be retrieved.

In this project, link prediction based on feature-based machine learning method is applied to implement friend recommender system. First, different sampling methods are applied to retrieve the whole social network graph, then two community detection methods, infomap and louvian algorithms, are applied to cut graph into small communities. In each cluster, different similarities, which are regarded as features, are calculated for each vertex. After feature selection, different classifers are trained. Random forest performs best with 96% area under accuracy and 71% area under precisionrecall.
